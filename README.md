# Volunteer manager

For configuring the client we first
```
cd .\client
```
from the root of the project.

Then we will require the npm package manager to be installed in order to use a more modern manager used for this client called pnpm
```
npm i -g pnpm
```
For other installing configurations you can check the packages [site](https://pnpm.io/installation)

After installing the package manager the dependencies of the project can be installed using the command:
```
pnpm i
```
The client also requires setting up some environment variables:
- VITE_API_HOST=localhost (the host of the API server)
- VITE_API_PORT=8080 (the exposed port of the server)

Then the client can be started using the command:
```
pnpm run dev
